####    Description: This is a program that can find the currency name, capital name and their state language. The python library that has been used in this project is selenium. At first it opens the web-browser, chrome in this case and goes to the link: <https://cosmocode.io/automation-practice-webtable> where it contains every country's capital, currency and primary language. Then it gets the name of the currency or the capital or primary language or all of them after the required country's name has been input. At last it returns the required result.
